# A postcard

Finally got it, the Milky Way (by "cartoon" monthly shogi player) <br>
Tentatively, it was completed. Finally I can write a postscript. The main motivation for making Clover 2 is that Clover is convenient, though it is not processing speed anyway. For that reason, we have thoroughly simplified the places where Clover 2 seems to be problematic in terms of speed. Language specification is simple and bragging specification. Method call can also be specified at compile time in most cases, so method call can not be done any faster. The method call of the interface is done dynamically, but I think that it is no problem on the speed side just by tracing the hash table with O (1). Unlike Clover, lambda and closure are first class objects. Self-praised in that area, I think that I could do well. At first I was making LLVM conscious, but while I was making it, the formation of LLVM was torn down. Instead I made an interpreter. Since Clover 2 is an open class, it is easy to add methods to the shell as you'd expect. That area is very convenient. <br>
However, there are still unanswered questions. Although it is also made into LLVM, when processing large files with regular expression speed is not good. Processing will settled if you use p "src /". Glob ("*. C"). Grep (/ main /) etc. in the current directory of Clover 2 source. I'd like to continue improving with the aim of version 1.5 as a problem. For me this is the last project. I will not do new projects anymore. UNIX projects have been doing mfiler, mfiler 2, mfiler 3, mfiler 4, xyzsh, clover for about 15 years, but from now on I would like to improve Clover 2 and spend the rest of my life. I am also interested in Python and Raspberry Pi, so I would like to study Python, electronically work with Raspberry Pi, and I would like to continue coding freely with Clover 2 in future. <br>
My wife who accepted the coding as a hobby at the end and watched over with kindness (though I get angry sometimes) I'm the creator of yash who lent me Fedora's VPS server The part was developing Clover 2 on this server), I thank my parents who took care of my money during the youth when I was only doing coding. Also I would like to thank my colleagues at the workplace who help me in my workplace and have taken over private consultation. <br>
<br>
Then enjoy programing! <br>
