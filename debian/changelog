    * Modification of GC algorithm. Segmentation violated when finalizers in GC needed more memory, but it was fixed. LLVM was not able to respond properly, but it was fixed. Corresponds to LLVM 3.8 and LLVM 4.0 later.

clover2 (4.1.8-1) unstable; urgency=medium

    * I created a search path routine for include files of class source files. Files in $ PREFIX / share / clover 2 and ~ /. Clover 2 are searched in addition to the current directory. If you include "MyOwnLibrary.clcl" etc in cclover2 - core a.clcl etc, you can modify the basic library. Fixed a bug in file search routines for class files, modules, and include files. The class file of the current directory takes precedence. Also, the directory where the script file is located is also added to the search routine. I changed the specification of the exception. You can catch not only when calling a method but also when an exception occurs at the top of the script. We have made Clover.onException output the exception message. Please change the output destination when CGI or terminal control. You can do so by overriding Clover.onException (String, bool): static. Fixed a bug that parsing does not pass like -x Fixed a bug that seems to be a command without a character string including a fix thought to be an operator.The class compilation is abolished.

	REPL, completion of class field of System class is also effective. I made a
	library of Socket. See Socket.clcl for details. port of the system call.
	Porting the ioctl system call. Porting of select system call. Mutex bug may be fixed.

    * There was a bug that will handle if it is the end of a regular expression if you use a character that uses / in regular expressions. I tried to avoid it with \/. Addition of String.removeTag ()

clover2 (4.0.5-1) unstable; urgency=medium

    * The class field of the System class can now omit the notation System. In
	other words, access(fname, R_OK) == 0 etc is compiled.  I put
	String.decodeFromForm (). It is useful in CGI. Refactoring processing of
	identifiers. I think there was a bug. Fix. Class names can now be omitted
	when calling class methods and class fields of the same class.

clover2 (4.0.4-1) unstable; urgency=medium

    * Multi line string bug was fiexed.

    * Threads were added. For details, please read the explanation of Thread class.  def allocSize (): int allows you to specify the size of the memory to get from the heap. We mainly use it in extension library.  The allocatedSize () special method was added. Returns the size of the memory retrieved from the heap of the object.      It mainly uses extended libraries, so users will not use them in particular.  The headOfmemory () special method was added. Returns the starting size of the memory obtained from the heap of the object. It is mainly used for extended libraries, so users will not use them in particular.
